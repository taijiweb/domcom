If a file has already passed through on the last run it will not be passed downstream. This means you only process what you need and save time + resources.\n\nTake this example:\n\n```javascript\nvar cache = require('gulp-cached');\n\ngulp.task('lint', function(){\n  return gulp.src('files/*.js')\n    .pipe(cache('linting'))\n    .pipe(jshint())\n    .pipe(jshint.reporter())\n});\n\ngulp.task('watch', function(){\n  gulp.watch('files/*.js', ['lint']);\n});\n\ngulp.task('default', ['watch','lint']);\n```\n\n- User saves `files/a.js` and the `lint` task is called\n  - the files do not exist in the cache yet\n  - `files/a.js` and `files/b.js` are linted\n- User saves `files/b.js` and the `lint` task is called\n  - the contents of the file changed from the previous value\n  - `files/b.js` is linted\n- User saves `files/a.js` and the `lint` task is called\n  - the contents of the file have not changed from the previous value\n  - nothing is linted\n\nSo the first run will emit all of the items downstream. Runs after that will only emit if it has been changed from the last file that passed through it with the same path.\n\nPlease note that this will not work with plugins that operate on sets of files (concat for example).\n\n### cache(cacheName[, opt])\n\nCreates a new cache hash or uses an existing one.\n\nCache key = file.path + file.contents\n\nIf a file exists in the cache, it is ignored.\n\nIf a file doesn't exist in the cache, it is passed through as is and added to the cache.\n\nThe last cache for this path is cleared so if you modify a file to a, then to b, then back to a all 3 will be a cache miss.\n\n#### Possible options\n\n`optimizeMemory` - Uses md5 instead of storing the whole file contents. Better if you are worried about large files and their effect on memory consumption. Default is `false`. In my experience this doesn't make much of a difference (only 25mb vs 26mb) but with a lot of files or a few large files this could be a big deal.\n\n### Clearing the cache\n\n#### Clearing the whole cache\n\n```js\ncache.caches = {};\n```\n\n#### Clearing a specific\n\n```js\ndelete cache.caches['cache name yo'];\n```\n\n## LICENSE\n\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Fractal <contact@wearefractal.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
